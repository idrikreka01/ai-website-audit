This shows up right on the homepage where the page loads but takes longer than expected to fully settle, making early navigation feel less dependable. Prioritize making the first view stable and usable fast by compressing oversized homepage images, deferring non-essential scripts, and confirming the header and primary navigation render first without visible movement. After these changes, monitor bounce rate and clicks into key categories, and consider an A/B test that compares the current load behavior versus a “fast-first” version to see whether more buyers reach product browsing sooner.",

The biggest blocker here is that the product page experience appears to be missing or failing to load in the audit context, which likely prevents buyers from accessing the detailed information and reassurance they need before committing, and this is likely lowering conversions. This shows up specifically at the product page level, where the expected product details, proof, and comparison content may not be reliably available when a shopper lands from search, ads, or category browsing. The most direct action is to confirm product pages consistently render for first-time visitors across devices and browsers, then ensure the core sections (price, key benefits, sizing/fit, materials, delivery/returns, and reviews) appear without delays or errors. Once stability is confirmed, run a simple A/B test on the product page’s above-the-fold messaging and proof order to see whether buyers engage more with key details and move to “Add to Cart” with fewer hesitations.",

This shows up specifically on the checkout page, where it took longer than the recommended few seconds to fully load and stabilize, which likely makes the page feel less reliable to time-sensitive shoppers. Prioritize checkout speed and stability by auditing the heaviest scripts and third-party tags on checkout, deferring anything not required to complete payment, and confirming key elements (order summary, shipping, payment fields) render consistently without shifting. After improvements, run a simple before/after test on checkout completion rate and time-to-interactive to confirm buyers move through payment with fewer drop-offs and less hesitation.",
